# Todolist Example for Hatchbox.io

This Rails app is a simple little example Postgres and Rails application
to showcase how easy it is to deploy to
[Hatchbox.io](https://hatchbox.io). All you've got to do is
select this repository to deploy on your server and you're all set!

Hatchbox.io is built by [Chris Oliver](https://excid3.com) of [GoRails](https://gorails.com).

Testing webhook deploys don't trigger this branch.
